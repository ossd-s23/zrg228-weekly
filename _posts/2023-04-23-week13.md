# Weekly Summary

## Discussion on open source

This week in class we discussed open source as it pertains to various industries. We saw how the readings we did in [The Cathedral and The Bazzar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)
are quite practical in various industries. The discussion touched on a few of the benefits on investing in open source projects. One was the ability to have people
contributing to your project even when you are not paying them. Another major advantage of open-source software for private companies, is the ability to be able to
start using software for free and then investing in the continued development of that software as it becomes increasingly useful. We watched in interview with the head of 
open source at U.S. Bank, [Gil Yehuda](https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/company-blog/article-library/gil-yehuda-opens-the-door-to-open-source-at-us-bank.html) who spoke
about the rising usage for open-source software in the finance industry. He mentioned how the digitization of so many things that come up in our lives has caused a reliance
on technology which, in turn, creates further demand for open-source tech. 

## Update On Project

This week I reported a formal issue via GitHub about one of the [issues](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/10489) I was having during the installation process.
I included the issue I had with the terminal response and the solution that me and Jose discovered for the issue. The issue was ultimately closed because there was someone
else reporting a similar issue and the administrators wanted to move the discussion [there](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/10502). Part of the problem
was that I had difficulty recreating the issue to be able to copy and paste the terminal response. Ultimately, we had a good discussion about how best to solve the issue
and the conversation taught me alot about long term solutions that will help future developers versus short term ones that just get you to the next stage.
