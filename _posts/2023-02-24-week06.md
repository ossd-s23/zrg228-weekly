## Week Summary


This week I further explored many open source projects to potentially work on for the rest of the semester. Its interesting how different projects have different ways
of organizing their repositories and communicating with contributers and users. Each one using their communication channel differently and each one has a unique way of
dividing issues and dealing with pull requests. 

I have also come to realize that the language of the projects is going to be an important factor for me when working on any open source project. For the most part,
I want to be working with projects where the primary language is one that I am somewhat familiar with. Another major factor is the goals of the project. I would like to
join a project where the purpose of the work is for a cause or product which I am interested in. Machine learning, disaster prepardeness and MedTech are just some of the
areas where I could see myself contributing. 

Approaching a new project obviously comes with challenges. I know that its going to be difficult to adapt to a new environment where many of the contributors have been
there for a while and underrstand the contribution process for that repository better than me. Another major challenge will likely be familirizing myself with the codebase
of the project. These repositories are often of tremendous size. The way to overcome both of these challenges is through preperation. Reaching out to the founders/administrators
of the project seems to be a good way to understand where my help could be most useful. And in terms of the codebase, spending sometime understanding the code structure
and common formats throughout the repository, will make it much more likely that I will have pull requests accepted.

Could not be more excited to start contributing!
