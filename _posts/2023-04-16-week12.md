# Weekly Summary

## Project Update


This week me and my groupmates continued our ongoing contact with the administrators and developers at kolibri. We continued working on the issues we were assigned which include making sure our servers are working and organizing what issues and solutions we want to place in the windows installation issue that we are going to create. In the upcoming week we hope t osubmit a PR on the issue that we were assigned to and to make progress on the windows issue that we plan to create.

## Personal work

This week, I took a bit of a break in terms of personnal contributions (partially due to Passover) but I had made an extra one last week. I wanted to take some time to think about other ways I can contribute to things and try something besides the 3 main avenues I was engaged in before. Also because of the holiday, I was not able to make it to the invited speaker but I am eager to hear from my classmates how it went.
