# Weekly Update

## Project update

This week we were finally able to finish setting up the development environment and all the dependencies. As a group, we are at a point where we can begin working on some issues. We got one of the issues on github assigned to us and are beggining to work on it. Also, there was a note in the set up documents that mentioned the Kolibri is looking for feedback on the development environent for windows users and we as a group definetely have a lot to add on that front. We continue to be in contact with the team via Slack, email and GitHub.

## Contributions update

This week I made a second contribution to OpenStreetMaps marking a new local shop that opened up in my neighborhood.

## Readings
In "The Cathedral and the Bazzar", Eric Raymond emphasizes much of what we have been speaking about throughout the semester. He discuss his experience being a developer on the Linux operating system and about how it showed him the benefit of open-source development projects. He discusses how his original idea for what the ideal development environment is, changed drastically after his experience contributing to Linux. One individual benefit that caught my eye was when he speaks about issues and contributions being user driven. When you have so many developers willing to work on issues constantly it becomes easy to put out a version, have users give feedback and then go back to the drawing board in order to improve.
