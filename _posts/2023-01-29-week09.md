# Week Summary

## Jim Hall talk

This week we heard from Jim Hall, the founder of the FreeDOS project. The FreeDOS project is an open source opeerating system that runs mostly legacy software.
It was interesting to hear from Jim about how he went about starting the project back in 1994 when you still needed physical drives to upload code. I was also fascinated 
by the fact that there are still current updates to the software which creates new use cases for current users. These users are mainly people trying to play 
legacy games that run on DOS systems. Jim had an interesting perspective on text editors. He said that he uses different editors dfepending on the project he was working on. 

## Project update

This week, our group furthered our efforts to set up the development environment on our local machines. All of us were able to install the env and download most of the 
dependencies required. We are currently still working on figuring out how to get the last couple of downloads to sync within the env. While we are still struggling we do
not anticipate this being a preventing factor from us continuing to work on the project. We have made legitimate progress in working through most of the issues we have had thus far and continue to expect that to be the case.
