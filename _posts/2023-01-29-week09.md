# Week Summary

## Jim Hall talk

This week we heard from Jim Hall, the founder of the FreeDOS project. The FreeDOS project is an open source opeerating system that runs mostly legacy software.
It was interesting to hear from Jim about how he went about starting the project back in 1994 when you still needed physical drives to upload code. I was also fascinated 
by the fact that there are still current updates to the software which creates new use cases for current users. These users are mainly people trying to play 
legacy games that run on DOS systems.
