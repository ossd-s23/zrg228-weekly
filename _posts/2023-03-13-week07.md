# Week 7 Recap

## Start to project

This past me and my new group began discussions on what open source project we would like to work on for the rest of the semester. We discussed some of our interets and where they overlapped. One of the things that we decided on, was that we would prefer a project that does meaningful work and where we could make legitimate contributions. We also noticed that it was going to be important to have an active developer community where there are current issues being worked on and where discourse is open and constant.
