# Weekly Update

## Project update

This past week we were finally able to begin working on an [issue](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/pull/10424) with the kolibri project. It was a documentation
issue that involved removing some text about a version update and making sure that the information that was still on the page was still being conveyed correctly. In addtition
we also took on another [issue](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/10335) which involves some front-end detailing. We began discussing some further instalment 
issues we were having in attempting to run the server. So far, the administrators have been fairly responsive in the process and are being quite helpful. This conversation is
particulary productive because Kolibri is looking for feedback on issues that Windows developers are having.

In the coming week, we hope to submit a PR for the docs issue and continue pursuing proper installation in order to tackle the second issue.

## Class discussion

This week in class, we spoke about ["The Cathedral and the Bazzar"](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) and had an interesting discussion about the 
pros and cons of an open-source development environment. One detail in particular which I thought was interesting was when we went on a tangent and discussed the proper
approach for beginners learning how to code.
